Since points \ud835\udc46, \ud835\udc44, and \ud835\udc4b form a triangle, it follows from the triangle angle sum theorem that the measure, in degrees, of \u2220\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc4b is 180-48-86, or 46.

      "distractors": [],
      "explanation": "The correct answer is 518.4. It's given that the area of the original poster is 360 square inches. Let \ud835\udc59 represent the length, in inches, of the original poster, and let \ud835\udc64 represent the width, in inches, of the original poster. Since the area of a rectangle is equal to its length times its width, it follows that 360=\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc64. It's also given that a copy of the poster is made in which the length and width of the original poster are each increased by 20%. It follows that the length of the copy is the length of the original poster plus 20% of the length of the original poster, which is equivalent to \ud835\udc59+ 12000\ud835\udc59 inches. This length can be rewritten as \ud835\udc59+0.2\ud835\udc59 inches, or 1.2\ud835\udc59 inches. Similarly, the width of the copy is the width of the original poster plus 20% of the width of the original poster, which is equivalent to \ud835\udc64+ 12000\ud835\udc64 inches. This width can be rewritten as \ud835\udc64+0.2\ud835\udc64 inches, or 1.2\ud835\udc64 inches. Since the area of a rectangle is equal to its length times its width, it follows that the area, in square inches, of the copy is equal to 1.2\ud835\udc591.2\ud835\udc64, which can be rewritten as 1.21.2\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc64. Since 360=\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc64, the area, in square inches, of the copy can be found by substituting 360 for \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc64 in the expression 1.21.2\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc64, which yields 1.21.2360, or 518.4. Therefore, the area of the copy, in square inches, is 518.4."

      "distractors": [],
      "explanation": "The correct answer is 44. It's given that in triangle \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47, angle \ud835\udc47 is a right angle. The area of a right triangle can be found 3 using the formula \ud835\udc34= 12\ud835\udc591\ud835\udc592, where \ud835\udc34 represents the area of the right triangle, \ud835\udc591 represents the length of one leg of the \u00af \u00af triangle, and \ud835\udc592 represents the length of the other leg of the triangle. In triangle \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47, the two legs are \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47 and \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47. Therefore, if the length of \ud835\udc45\u00af\ud835\udc47 is 72 and the area of triangle \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47 is 792, then 792= 1272\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47, or 792=36\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47. Dividing both sides of this equation by 36 yields 22=\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47. Therefore, the length of \ud835\udc46\u00af\ud835\udc47 is 22. It's also given that point \ud835\udc3f lies on \ud835\udc45\u00af\ud835\udc46, point \ud835\udc3e lies on \ud835\udc46\u00af\ud835\udc47, and \u00af \u00af \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3e is parallel to \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47. It follows that angle \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc46 is a right angle. Since triangles \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47 and \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3e share angle \ud835\udc46 and have right \u00af angles \ud835\udc47 and \ud835\udc3e, respectively, triangles \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47 and \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3e are similar triangles. Therefore, the ratio of the length of \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47 to the length of \ud835\udc3f\u00af\ud835\udc3e is equal to the ratio of the length of \ud835\udc46\u00af\ud835\udc47 to the length of \ud835\udc46\u00af\ud835\udc3e. If the length of \ud835\udc45\u00af\ud835\udc47 is 72 and the length of \ud835\udc3f\u00af\ud835\udc3e is 24, it \u00af \u00af 72 3 \u00af \u00af 3 follows that the ratio of the length of \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47 to the length of \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3e is , or , so the ratio of the length of \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47 to the length of \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3e is . 24 Therefore, 22 =3. Multiplying both sides of this equation by \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3e yields 22=3\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3e. Dividing both sides of this equation by 3 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3e yields 22 =\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3e. Since the length of \ud835\udc46\u00af\ud835\udc47, 22, is the sum of the length of \ud835\udc46\u00af\ud835\udc3e, 22, and the length of \ud835\udc3e\u00af\ud835\udc47, it follows that the length of 3 3 \ud835\udc3e\u00af\ud835\udc47 is 22- 232, or 434. Note that 44/3, 14.66, and 14.67 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer."

The equation of a circle in the xy-plane with its center at \u210e,\ud835\udc58 and a radius of \ud835\udc5f can be written in the form \ud835\udc65-\u210e2 +\ud835\udc66-\ud835\udc582 =\ud835\udc5f2. It's given that a circle in the xy-plane has its center at -5,2 and has a radius of 9. Substituting -5 for \u210e, 2 for \ud835\udc58, and 9 for \ud835\udc5f in the equation \ud835\udc65-\u210e2 +\ud835\udc66-\ud835\udc582 =\ud835\udc5f2 yields \ud835\udc65--52 +\ud835\udc66-22 =92, or \ud835\udc65+52 +\ud835\udc66-22 =81.

The diagonal of a rectangle forms a right triangle, where the shorter side and the longer side of the rectangle are the legs of the triangle and the diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of the triangle. It's given that the length of the rectangle's diagonal is 3\u221a17 and the length of the rectangle's shorter side is 3. Thus, the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the diagonal is 3\u221a17 and the length of one of the legs is 3. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length \ud835\udc50 and legs with lengths \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc4f, then \ud835\udc4e2 +\ud835\udc4f2 =\ud835\udc502. Substituting 3\u221a17 for \ud835\udc50 and 3 for \ud835\udc4f in this equation yields \ud835\udc4e2 +32 =3\u221a172, or \ud835\udc4e2 +9=153.

Since \ud835\udc4e represents a length, which must be positive, the value of \ud835\udc4e is 12. Thus, the length of the rectangle's longer side is 12."

Therefore, in triangle \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc39, if tan\ud835\udc37= 2210, the ratio of the length of \ud835\udc38\u00af\ud835\udc39 to the length of \u00af 21 \u00af \u00af 21 20 \u00af \u00af 21 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc39 is . If the lengths of \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc39 and \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc39 are and , respectively, then the ratio of the length of \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc39 to the length of \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc39 is . In 20 20 a right triangle, the sine of an acute angle is the ratio of the length of the leg opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. Therefore, the value of sin\ud835\udc37 is the ratio of the length of \ud835\udc38\u00af\ud835\udc39 to the length of \ud835\udc37\u00af\ud835\udc38. The length of \ud835\udc37\u00af\ud835\udc38 can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that if the lengths of the legs of a right triangle are \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc4f and the length of the hypotenuse is \ud835\udc50, then \ud835\udc4e2 +\ud835\udc4f2 =\ud835\udc502. Therefore, if the lengths of \ud835\udc38\u00af\ud835\udc39 and \ud835\udc37\u00af\ud835\udc39 are 21 and 20, respectively, then 212 +202 =\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc382, or 841=\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc382. Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields 29=\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc38. Therefore, if the lengths of \ud835\udc38\u00af\ud835\udc39 and \ud835\udc37\u00af\ud835\udc39 are 21 and 20, respectively, then the length of \ud835\udc37\u00af\ud835\udc38 is 29 and the ratio of the length of \ud835\udc38\u00af\ud835\udc39 to the length of \ud835\udc37\u00af\ud835\udc38 is 2219. Thus, if tan\ud835\udc34= 2210, the value of sin\ud835\udc37 is 2219. Note that 21/29, .7241, and 0.724 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer."

      "distractors": [],
      "explanation": "The correct answer is 2 . In the \ufb01gure, lines \ud835\udc5e, \ud835\udc5f, and \ud835\udc60 form a triangle. One interior angle of this triangle is vertical to the angle marked \ud835\udc4e\u00b0; therefore, the interior angle also has measure \ud835\udc4e\u00b0. It's given that \ud835\udc4e=43. Therefore, the interior angle of the triangle has measure 43\u00b0. A second interior angle of the triangle forms a straight line, \ud835\udc5e, with the angle marked \ud835\udc4f\u00b0. Therefore, the sum of the measures of these two angles is 180\u00b0. It's given that \ud835\udc4f=122. Therefore, the angle marked \ud835\udc4f\u00b0 has measure 122\u00b0 and the second interior angle of the triangle has measure 180-122\u00b0, or 58\u00b0. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0. Therefore, the measure of the third interior angle of the triangle is 180-43-58\u00b0, or 79\u00b0. It's given that parallel lines \ud835\udc5e and \ud835\udc61 are intersected by line \ud835\udc5f. It follows that the triangle's interior angle with measure 79\u00b0 is congruent to the same side interior angle between lines \ud835\udc5e and \ud835\udc61 formed by lines \ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc5f. Since this angle is supplementary to the two angles marked \ud835\udc64\u00b0, the sum of 79\u00b0, \ud835\udc64\u00b0, and \ud835\udc64\u00b0 is 180\u00b0. It follows that 79+\ud835\udc64+\ud835\udc64=180, or 79+2\ud835\udc64=180. Subtracting 79 from both sides of this equation yields 2\ud835\udc64=101. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields \ud835\udc64= 1021. Note that 101/2 and 50.5 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer."

In similar triangles, the tangents of corresponding angles are equal. Since angle \ud835\udc34 and angle \ud835\udc37 are corresponding angles, if tan\ud835\udc34= 50, then tan\ud835\udc37= 50. It's also given that angles \ud835\udc36 and \ud835\udc39 are right angles.
