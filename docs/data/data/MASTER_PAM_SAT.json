It’s given that a line with equation 2𝑦=4.5 intersects a parabola with equation 𝑦= -4𝑥2 +𝑏𝑥, where 𝑏 is a positive constant, at exactly one point in the xy-plane. It follows that the system of equations consisting of 2𝑦=4.5 and 𝑦= -4𝑥2 +𝑏𝑥 has exactly one solution. Dividing both sides of the equation of the line by 2 yields 𝑦=2.25. Substituting 2.25 for 𝑦 in the equation of the parabola yields 2.25= -4𝑥2 +𝑏𝑥. Adding 4𝑥2 and subtracting 𝑏𝑥 from both sides of this equation yields 4𝑥2 -𝑏𝑥+2.25=0. A quadratic equation in the form of 𝑎𝑥2 +𝑏𝑥+𝑐=0, where 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 are constants, has exactly one solution when the discriminant, 𝑏2 -4𝑎𝑐, is equal to zero. Substituting 4 for 𝑎 and 2.25 for 𝑐 in the expression 𝑏2 -4𝑎𝑐 and setting this expression equal to 0 yields 𝑏2 -4(4)(2.25)=0, or 𝑏2 -36=0. Adding 36 to each side of this equation yields 𝑏2 =36. Taking the square root of each side of this equation yields 𝑏= ±6. It’s given that 𝑏 is positive, so the value of 𝑏 is 6."

      "explanation": "The correct answer is 3.44. It’s given that 𝑓0=86 and that for each increase in 𝑥 by 1, the value of 𝑓𝑥 decreases by 80%. Because the output of the function decreases by a constant percentage for each 1-unit increase in the value of 𝑥, this relationship can be represented by an exponential function of the form 𝑓𝑥=𝑎𝑏𝑥, where 𝑎 represents the initial value of the function and 𝑏 represents the rate of decay, expressed as a decimal. Because 𝑓0=86, the value of 𝑎 must be 86. Because the value of 𝑓𝑥 decreases by 80% for each 1- unit increase in 𝑥, the value of 𝑏 must be (1−0.80), or 0.2. Therefore, the function 𝑓 can be defined by 𝑓𝑥=860.2𝑥. Substituting 2 for 𝑥 in this function yields 𝑓2=860.22, which is equivalent to 𝑓2=860.04, or 𝑓2=3.44. Either 3.44 or 86/25 may be entered as the correct answer. Alternate approach: It’s given that 𝑓0=86 and that for each increase in 𝑥 by 1, the value of 𝑓𝑥 decreases by 80%. Therefore, when 𝑥=1, the value of 𝑓𝑥 is (100−80)%, or 20%, of 86, which can be expressed as 0.2086. Since 0.2086=17.2, the value of 𝑓1 is 17.2. Similarly, when 𝑥=2, the value of 𝑓𝑥 is 20% of 17.2, which can be expressed as 0.2017.2. Since 0.2017.2=3.44, the value of 𝑓2 is 3.44. Either 3.44 or 86/25 may be entered as the correct answer."

It's also given that the table shows three values of 𝑥 and their corresponding values of 𝑦, where 𝑦=𝑓𝑥+4. Substituting 𝑎𝑥-ℎ2 +𝑘 for 𝑓𝑥 in this equation yields 𝑦=𝑎𝑥-ℎ2 +𝑘+4. This equation represents a quadratic relationship between 𝑥 and 𝑦, where 𝑘+4 is either the maximum or the minimum value of 𝑦, which occurs when 𝑥=ℎ. For quadratic relationships between 𝑥 and 𝑦, the maximum or minimum value of 𝑦 occurs at the value of 𝑥 halfway between any two values of 𝑥 that have the same corresponding value of 𝑦. The table shows that x-values of 21 and 25 correspond to the same y-value, -8. Since 23 is halfway between 21 and 25, the maximum or minimum value of 𝑦 occurs at an x-value of 23. The table shows that when 𝑥=23, 𝑦=8. It follows that ℎ=23 and 𝑘+4=8. Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation 𝑘+4=8 yields 𝑘=4. Substituting 23 for ℎ and 4 for 𝑘 in the equation 𝑦=𝑎𝑥-ℎ2 +𝑘+4 yields 𝑦=𝑎𝑥-232 +4+4, or 𝑦=𝑎𝑥-232 +8. The value of 𝑎 can be found by substituting any x-value and its corresponding y-value for 𝑥 and 𝑦, respectively, in this equation. Substituting 25 for 𝑥 and -8 for 𝑦 in this equation yields -8=𝑎25-232 +8, or -8=𝑎22 +8. Subtracting 8 from both sides of this equation yields -16=𝑎22, or -16=4𝑎. Dividing both sides of this equation by 4 yields -4=𝑎. Substituting -4 for 𝑎, 23 for ℎ, and 4 for 𝑘 in the equation 𝑓𝑥=𝑎𝑥-ℎ2 +𝑘 yields 𝑓𝑥= -4𝑥-232 +4. The y- intercept of the graph of 𝑦=𝑓𝑥 in the xy-plane is the point on the graph where 𝑥=0. Substituting 0 for 𝑥 in the equation 𝑓𝑥= -4𝑥-232 +4 yields 𝑓0= -40-232 +4, or 𝑓0= -4-232 +4. This is equivalent to 𝑓0= -2,112, so the y-intercept of the graph of 𝑦=𝑓𝑥 in the xy-plane is 0, -2,112. Thus, the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph of 𝑦=𝑓𝑥 in the xy-plane is -2,112."
